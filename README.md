🕹️ How to Play
Run the project:
python main.py
Choose whether to use Alpha-Beta Pruning (y/n).

The board is labeled from 0 to 8:
0 | 1 | 2
3 | 4 | 5
6 | 7 | 8

Enter the number where you want to place your move.

The AI will respond with its move instantly!

🔥 Features
✅ Play against an unbeatable AI.

✅ Choose between simple Minimax and optimized Alpha-Beta Pruning.

✅ Simple and intuitive console-based interface.

✅ Efficient and fast decision-making even on full boards.

🚀 How it Works
Minimax Algorithm
AI tries to maximize its score, while assuming you (the opponent) will minimize it.

It explores all possible future game states before making a move.

Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimization over Minimax.

It cuts off ("prunes") branches that won't affect the final decision.

Results in faster gameplay and less computation.

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x (no external libraries needed!)

✨ Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe-AI-Minimax-AlphaBeta.git
cd TicTacToe-AI-Minimax-AlphaBeta

Run the game:
python main.py


📈 Future Enhancements (optional)
GUI version using Pygame.

Multiplayer mode.

Score tracking system.
