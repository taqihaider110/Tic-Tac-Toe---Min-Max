## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Run the project:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Choose whether to use Alpha-Beta Pruning** (`y/n`).
3. **Board Layout**:

    ```
    0 | 1 | 2
    3 | 4 | 5
    6 | 7 | 8
    ```

4. **Enter the number** where you want to place your move.
5. **The AI will instantly respond** with its move!

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ **Play against an unbeatable AI.**
- ✅ **Choose between basic Minimax** and optimized **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
- ✅ **Simple and intuitive console-based interface.**
- ✅ **Fast decision-making**, even with a full board.

## 🚀 How it Works

### Minimax Algorithm

The **Minimax algorithm** is a decision-making algorithm used to play the game optimally by:

- **Maximizing** the AI's score, while assuming the opponent is trying to minimize it.
- **Exploring all possible future game states** to determine the best possible move.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

**Alpha-Beta Pruning** is an optimization for the Minimax algorithm:

- It **prunes** branches in the game tree that will not influence the final decision.
- This reduces the number of nodes the AI has to evaluate, speeding up the decision-making process.
